            <h1>How to fix common issues yourself:</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>
            <strong>Dirty Filters</strong><br>
            Common HVAC problems usually stem from a lack of air conditioning system maintenance, and failing to change your filters often enough can negatively impact your HVAC unit’s performance. Clean filters allow the air to circulate better and help your home cool down quicker.<br> 
              </li>   
              <li>
            <strong>Thermostat Settings</strong><br>
            Though it may seem obvious, many common HVAC problems are related to the thermostat settings. If your settings are incorrect, it can influence the way your HVAC performs. Many modern thermostats utilize digital controls to help users set up their own personal configurations. You can even control your unit remotely utilizing these devices.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wear and Tear</strong><br>
            Every HVAC unit is susceptible to wear and tear. Even if you service the unit regularly, you may notice that it’s performance has diminished overtime. If you can diagnose this type of problem early on, professional HVAC technicians may be able to help you repair the unit or replace certain components to return it to working order.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Uneven Cooling</strong><br>
            You may discover that while your HVAC unit cools part of your home, it has trouble reaching others. This issue may not be with the unit itself, but may have to do with sealing issues which allow cold air to escape from your home. If you can find the location of your home that remains stuffy even when your AC unit is on, you may be able to seal it off to create more efficient and even airflow.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Issues with Coils</strong><br>
            Many HVAC units use coils, and these components play a large part in how the units function. If you notice that your coils seem to be corroded or at risk of breaking apart, it may be time to call in the professionals. While some of these issues can be handled by any homeowner, others require professional attention. But by diagnosing these common problems yourself, you can save yourself an appointment and get the solution you need for your HVAC unit quicker.
